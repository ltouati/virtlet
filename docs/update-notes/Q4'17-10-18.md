* Implemented the `kubectl port-forward` command support to Virtlet.
  The command allows you to forward one or more local ports to a pod.
* Added `VirtletCloudInitUserDataSource` annotation that is used
  to create user-data from either ConfigMap or Secret.
  The syntax for the key is `[configmap|secret]/name`.
* Added `VirtletSSHKeySource` that can be used to include SSH keys
  from ConfigMap or Secret.
  The syntax for the key is `[configmap|secret]/name[/key]`.
  If the `key` part is omitted, `authorized_keys` is used.
* Implemented cloud-init user data
  [merge algorithm](http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/merging.html).
